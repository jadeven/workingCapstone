        My name is Joe Deveney and I live in Hawaii. I built this website simply
        because I want to give military members the ability to view the
        surf/wind/tide forecast for beaches on the military base as well as
        allow members to leave messages about dangerous riptides, rocks, and
        other zonal hazards. Im hoping that with this ability, service members
        stationed on bases in Hawaii will be able to gain a better understanding
        about the dangerous ocean environment prior to arriving at the beach.
